# Flight Data
CS316 project for Matt Dickson, Ziad Elarab, Sarah Fordham, Nat Huffman, Brian Lopez, Fall 2017.

## Getting Started

To load an instance of the SQL database, use the .sql scripts in src/sql/db_creation_scripts.zip. 
This creates all tables and triggers, and inserts some placeholder data into them, as well as running
some sample queries of the database.Note the data set is very large, and the data is being scraped via 
the Google Flights API (QPX).
